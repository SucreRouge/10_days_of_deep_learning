# 10 Days of Deep Learning

I took a challenge upon myself to fast pace my Deep Learning skills using the python data stack. I will take on a real life practical challenge everyday and try to solve it using Deep Learning (Starting from the basics)

## Day 1
> Text classification using Multi Layered Perceptron and comparing with NN's
#### TODO:
1. Use learning rate decay
2. Batch normalization
3. More number of epochs

## Day 2
> Text classification using TFIDF feature matrix and MLP
#### TODO:
1. Use LRD, Batch Normalisation
2. Use Dropout
3. Further process the TFIDF matrix using TruncatedSVD

## Day 3
> Text classification using word2vec and MLP
#### TODO:
1. Use LRD, Batch Normalisation, Dropout
3. Tweaking word2vec hyperparams
